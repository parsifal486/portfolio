The phrase “graduation equals unemployment” has become a grim reality for countless fresh graduates. When job applications go unanswered and interviews end in silence, self-doubt creeps in. The future looks uncertain, and anxiety sets in.\n\nBut what if we could see life through a different lens?\n\n## Think of Life as a Story—Every Chapter Has Its Role\n\nImagine your life as a grand novel—rich, layered, and full of twists. Each phase is a chapter: some bright and hopeful, others murky and tense. But it’s the contrast that gives the story its depth. As an old Chinese saying goes, “A good essay is like a mountain—its charm lies in its uneven terrain.”\n\nBeing unemployed after graduation isn’t the end of the story. It’s a suspenseful chapter, a turning point, maybe even the setup for a breakthrough. With this mindset, you stop viewing setbacks as failures, and start seeing them as part of your unfolding journey.\n\n## Anxiety Is Natural—Stagnation Is the Real Enemy\n\nAnxiety comes from uncertainty. The best remedy isn’t denial or despair, but action. Try things. Learn new skills. Talk to different people. Chase opportunities, however small. A part-time job, a spontaneous trip, a sudden spark of creativity—these could all become defining moments in your story.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nYou don’t get to write the beginning of your life’s story, but you absolutely get to shape the next chapters. Being unemployed after graduation is just one ripple in your long journey. Don’t let it define you. Embrace the anxiety as part of the process, and keep moving forward. Your next chapter might just surprise you.\n\n> You're not failing—you're storytelling.",
